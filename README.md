### In this project , our goal is not only  writing code that achieves our goal but also applying the principles for good code.

## Here , I am trying to apply these concepts ::
●Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY)
●Comments where needed
●Fail fast
●Avoid magic numbers
●One purpose for each variable
●Use good names
●No global variables
●Return results, don’t print them
●Use whitespace for readability
